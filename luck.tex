%seperate section, take short description from abstract for ISIPTA'09 poster?

%Section~\ref{sec:luck} gives a short overview on a software implementation of \nymodel s,
%the add-on package \texttt{luck} (citation) for the statistical programming environment \textbf{R} \parencite{2013:r}.

This secion gives a short overview on a software implementation of the models discussed in Section~\ref{sec:jstp},
the add-on package \texttt{luck} ***citation*** for the statistical programming environment \textbf{R} \parencite{2013:r}.

\medskip

In recent years, the statistical programming environment %software
\textbf{R} is used more and more frequently for every-day statistical analyses
in academia and inside corporations. %(Wikipedia)
It has also become a de facto standard among
statisticians for software implementations of novel methods,
which can be easily distributed by means of so-called \emph{packages}
%, additional functionality can be provided to \texttt{R} users
via the online repository `cran' (Comprehensive \textbf{R} Archive Network, \url{http://www.cran.R-project.org}).

%***implements the general model structure from Section~\ref{sec:jstp}.
The present implementation is programmed in a class system
that reflects %mirrors
the hierarchy between the unified description in terms of \model s%
\footnote{As described in footnote~\ref{foot:luckmodels}, page~\pageref{foot:luckmodels},
\model s generalise the framework
of canoncial conjugate priors from Section~\ref{sec:regularconjugates},
by requiring only the form of the update step \eqref{eq:canonicalupdate},
and not the specific functional form of \eqref{eq:expofam-sampledens} for $f(\x \mid \vartheta)$
(see Definition~\ref{070503-defin1}).}
and the concrete application of this framework by, e.g.,
considering inference on the mean of scaled normal distribution using sets of conjugate priors
(as described in Example~\ref{ex:ymodel-nv}).
%making extensions for arbitrary prior classes very easy.
This hierarchical structure makes extensions of the package inorder to
enable inference in wide class of sample distributions very easy.

Such hierarchical structures 
can be implemented using the object-oriented paradigm for programming.
The central tools in this paradigm are \emph{classes} and \emph{methods}.
\emph{Classes} are used to represent general concepts that should be modelled in software.
Such a concept is structured through a class by defining the traits that
examples for the general concept should have. 
Classes thus provide the blueprint for \emph{objects},
by defining a number of \emph{attributes} or \emph{slots} these objects have.
Given concrete values for the slots of the class,
a concrete object can be created according to the blueprint provided by the class definition.
%which concrete objects can be created.
These concrete realisations of a class are called \emph{instances}.
\emph{Methods} then provide functions to manipulate such instances,
the class description guaranteeing a standardised input for the functions.
However, the most prominent feature of the object-oriented paradigm is
that hierarchies between concepts can be modelled by \emph{inheritance}.
More specific concepts can be modelled as special cases of a general concept, % behind more general classes,
and the blueprint for such specialised objects are called \emph{subclasses},
which \emph{inherit} the traits of the more general class.

The package \texttt{luck} uses the S4 class system of
%***To recap, the present implementation is programmed in the S4 class system of
\textbf{R}, providing the basic framework for the definition, display and updating of
sets of priors based on \model s by defining the central class \texttt{LuckModel}.
Inferences in a concrete sample distribution are then carried out
using lean subclasses that make the `translation'
between the (abstract) \model\ framework and a concrete sample distribution.

For defining prior parameter sets $\PZ$,
the class \texttt{LuckModel} provides the slots \texttt{n0} for $\nz$, and \texttt{y0} for $\yz$, respectively,
the contents of which are defined internally as intervals,
but where the lower and upper bound may coincide,
such that both $\NZ$ and $\YZ$ can be either an interval or a singleton.%
\footnote{In case of $\byz \in \reals^k$, $\YZ$ may be a multidimensional interval,
i.e., a cartesian product of intervals $[\yzl_j,\yzu_j]$, $j=1,\ldots,k$,
(see Example~\ref{ex:ymodel-idm}),
with $\yzl$ and $\yzu$ denoting the vectors of these element-wise lower and upper bounds, respectively.} 
From the model types discussed in Section~\ref{sec:basicsetting}, type
(\ref{enum:modeltypes-a}), (\ref{enum:varyn}), and (\ref{enum:rectangular})
can thus be implemented by choosing \texttt{n0} and \texttt{y0} accordingly
as singletons or intervals.

To calculate the set of posterior distributions,
the class \texttt{LuckModel} also provides a \texttt{data} slot.
This must contain an object of class \texttt{LuckModelData},
providing the data in the needed form ($\tau(\x)$ and $n$).

As the posterior parameter sets $\PN$ resulting from updating all the priors in a
prior parameter set $\PZ$ are, in the most general case of $\PZ = [\nzl,\nzu] \times [\yzl, \yzu]$,
%\footnote{In the case of multidimensional $\byz$,
%$\ynl$ and $\ynu$ are understood as element-wise lower and upper bounds of $\YN$, respectively.}
not cartesian products of $[\nnl, \nnu]$ and $[\ynl, \ynu]$ anymore, posterior sets are not
explicitely represented as \texttt{LuckModel} objects. Whenever posterior quantities
are of interest (specified in functions or methods for \texttt{LuckModel} objects by the option \texttt{"posterior = TRUE")},
the range of these quantities are calculated by minimising and maximising over $\PN$, %the updated parameters,
which in turn can be done by a box-constrained optimisation over $\PZ$ %the set of prior parameters, as $\PZ$
that is a cartesian product.
This is why the data object (\texttt{LuckModelData}) is directly included in the \texttt{LuckModel} object.
For the box-constrained optimisation, a helper function called \texttt{wrapOptim} is used,
such that all cases (none, one or both of \texttt{n0} and \texttt{y0} %canonical parameters
are interval-valued) can be treated in the same way.%
\footnote{The function \texttt{optim} provided by \textbf{R} for general-purpose
multivariate optimisation is not recommended for univariate optimisation.}

As mentioned above, the class \texttt{LuckModel} in fact only implements the general superstructure as given in the
(abstract) definition of \model s (Definition~\ref{070503-defin1}).
For inference in a concrete distribution family like the Normal distribution,
this general framework must be concretised %. This can be done
by defining a subclass, inheriting from \texttt{LuckModel},
for this specific distribution family,
along with a subclass of \texttt{LuckModelData} to specify how $\tau(\x)$
is calculated for this distribution family.
Currently, this has been done for data from a scaled normal distribution,
i.e., $x_i \sim \norm(\mu, 1)$,%
\footnote{See Example~\ref{ex:ymodel-nv}.}
with the classes \texttt{ScaledNormalLuckModel} and \texttt{ScaledNormalData},
and for data from an exponential distribution, i.e., $x_i \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$,%
\footnote{See the study by \textcite{2011:krautenbacher},
who contributed the code for this distribution family.
The results of this study are breifly discussed in Section~\ref{sec:alternatives:other}.***}
with the classes \texttt{ExponentialLuckModel} and \texttt{ExponentialData}.

For illustrations of and workings*** with \texttt{LuckModel} objects, some methods have
been written. First, there are methods to display and print plain \texttt{LuckModel}
objects (existing only on the superstructure level):
\begin{itemize}
\item So-called \emph{constructor functions} for the \texttt{LuckModel} and \texttt{LuckModelData} class
   make the creation of \model s more easy. They can be supplied with a 
   number of different arguments, which are checked on consistency upon
   creation of the object.
\item Due to the S4 implementation, so-called \emph{accessor} and \emph{replacement functions}
   are defined, regulating the access and the replacement of object slots.
\item The \texttt{show} method prints the contents of a \texttt{LuckModel} object in more
   readable form. If the object contains a \texttt{LuckModelData object}, this is
   printed along as well, resorting on a \texttt{show} method for \texttt{LuckModelData}
   objects.\footnote{\texttt{show} methods are the S4 equivalent to \texttt{print} methods for S3 objects.}
\item The \texttt{plot} method for \texttt{LuckModel} objects represents the parameter sets graphically.
\end{itemize}

For concrete data distributions, there are methods for working with
and displaying the resulting sets of prior or posterior distributions.
\begin{itemize}
\item The constructor functions are modified, for example to check if the input
   fits to the data or prior distribution, or to allow the simulation of data
   according to the data distribution when creating the \texttt{LuckModelData} object.
\item The accessor and replacement functions need not be specified again for the
   specialized classes, as those can be taken from the general classes, i.e.,
   these functions are 'inherited' from the respective \texttt{LuckModel} or \texttt{LuckModelData}
   class. An exception is the function for replacing the raw data in the
   \texttt{LuckModelData object}, as there, the input must be checked to fit the sample
   space domain. As an example, in case of the \texttt{ExponentialData} class, data must be
   strictly positive.
\item The \texttt{show} methods for \texttt{LuckModel} and \texttt{LuckModelData} are specialised in order
   to explain to the user the meaning of the canonical parameters $\nz$ and $\yz$.
\item \texttt{unionHdi} calculates the union of highest density intervals for a
   specialised \texttt{LuckModel} object.%
   \footnote{Union of highest density intervals were discussed in Section~***.}
   This method relies on a function \texttt{singleHdi},
   that gives a highest density interval for a single parameter combination
   $(n, y)$ for the respective conjugate prior or posterior distribution.
   Therefore, for each specialised LuckModel class, \texttt{singleHdi} must be
   provided.
\item \texttt{cdfplot} plots the set of cumulative density functions for specialised
   \texttt{LuckModel} objects. Again, this method relies on a function \texttt{singleCdf},
   returning values of the cumulative density function for a single parameter combination $(n, y)$
   for the respective conjugate prior distribution.
\end{itemize}
